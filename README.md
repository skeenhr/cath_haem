Title: Periodicity of blood-borne pathogen prevalence in migratory birds provides evidence of cyclic population dynamics

Abstract: Ecological theory has shown that pathogens and parasites can drive predator-prey type cycles in the host population density, an hypothesis that has received support from studies of pathoens in mammals, non-migratory birds and insects. Meanwhile, vectored pathogens are known to cause virulent disease in birds, but whether these pathogens drive population cycles in birds is unknown. To test whether pathogen-driven population cycles occur in migratory birds, we collected long-term prevalence data in three genera of vectored Haemosporidian pathogens in four species of migratory {\it Catharus} thrushes over 24 years. By developing a novel statistical method, we show that pathogen infection rates in thrushes undergo both seasonal and multi-year fluctuations, with multi-year periods ranging from 3-12 years across pathogen genera and thrush species. We then show that a novel vectored-disease model can mimic the cycles in the data, including both the seasonal and multi-year cycles. Notably, modest changes in the biology of the host-pathogen interaction in the model can lead to cycles that match each of the multi-year periods in the data. Our model suggests that changes in infection rates are driven by fluctuations in thrush population densities, providing indirect evidence that pathogens drive population cycles in thrushes.
